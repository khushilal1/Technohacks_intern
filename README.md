SMS SPAM FILTERING

Introduction
Welcome to the SMS Spam Filtering System readme! This document provides an overview of the system and instructions for setting it up and using it effectively.

What is SMS Spam Filtering?
SMS Spam Filtering is a software system designed to detect and filter out unwanted and unsolicited text messages, commonly known as SMS spam. The goal of this system is to help users manage their SMS inbox and reduce the annoyance and potential risks associated with spam messages.

Features
The SMS Spam Filtering System offers the following features:

SMS Classification: The system classifies incoming SMS messages as either spam or not spam (ham) based on their content.

Custom Rules: Users can define custom rules for filtering messages based on keywords, sender numbers, or other criteria.

Blocking and Whitelisting: Users can block specific senders and whitelist trusted contacts.

Reporting: The system provides the ability to report and log spam messages for analysis and improvement.

User-friendly Interface: The system offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface for configuring and managing filtering settings.

Getting Started
To set up and use the SMS Spam Filtering System, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Operating System: The system can run on various operating systems such as Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Programming Language: This system is typically implemented in a programming language like Python.

Dependencies: Ensure that you have the necessary libraries or modules installed, such as natural language processing libraries (e.g., NLTK), SMS handling libraries, and any specific libraries for machine learning if applicable.

Installation
Download the System: Clone or download the SMS Spam Filtering System from the GitHub repository or the official website.

Install Dependencies: Use the package manager or installer for your chosen programming language to install the required dependencies.

Configuration
Set Up Rules: Define the filtering rules based on keywords, sender numbers, or other criteria. You may also configure rules for whitelisting trusted contacts and blocking specific senders.

Training (Optional): If the system uses machine learning for classification, you may need to train the model on a dataset of labeled SMS messages.

Usage
Run the System: Start the SMS Spam Filtering System.

Incoming Messages: As SMS messages arrive, the system will classify them as spam or not spam based on your predefined rules and any machine learning models in use.

Reporting: If a message is incorrectly classified, you can report it as spam or not spam to improve the system's accuracy.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues while setting up or using the SMS Spam Filtering System, consult the system's documentation for troubleshooting tips and common problems.

# House Price Prediction
## Overview

This House Price Prediction project is a machine learning-based system that predicts the selling prices of houses based on various features such as size, location, number of bedrooms, and more. It is a useful tool for real estate professionals, homeowners, and anyone interested in estimating the value of residential properties.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** The system includes data preprocessing steps to clean, transform, and prepare the dataset for training and testing.

- **Machine Learning Models:** Various regression models, such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, are employed to make accurate predictions.

- **Feature Selection:** The project utilizes feature selection techniques to identify the most relevant attributes for accurate predictions.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Hyperparameter optimization is performed to fine-tune the models and improve prediction accuracy.

- **Visualization:** The project provides data visualization tools to explore the dataset and understand the relationships between features and house prices.

## Requirements

To use this project, you will need the following:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
- Required Python libraries (specified in the `requirements.txt` file)

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.


3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended).

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'


4. Install the required Python libraries.

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook.


2. Open the `House_Price_Prediction.ipynb` notebook to start using the system.

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to load data, preprocess it, train machine learning models, and make predictions.

4. You can also modify the notebook to suit your specific needs, add more data, or change the machine learning models.

## Data

The project uses a dataset of historical house prices. You can replace the dataset with your own data, ensuring that it follows a similar structure (features and target variable).

## Acknowledgments

- The dataset used in this project is based on the [Kaggle House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) competition.







# Churn Prediction

## Overview

Churn Prediction is a machine learning project that focuses on predicting customer churn for businesses. It helps companies identify customers who are likely to leave and take proactive measures to retain them. This project is particularly valuable for subscription-based businesses, telecom companies, and others with a customer base.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** The system includes data preprocessing steps to clean, transform, and prepare the dataset for training and testing.

- **Machine Learning Models:** Various classification models, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, are employed to predict customer churn.

- **Feature Engineering:** The project uses feature engineering techniques to extract meaningful information from the data and improve model performance.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Hyperparameter optimization is performed to fine-tune the models and enhance prediction accuracy.

- **Evaluation Metrics:** The system provides metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to evaluate model performance.

- **Visualization:** Data visualization tools are used to create insightful graphs and charts to understand the dataset and model outputs.

## Requirements

To use this project, you will need the following:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
- Required Python libraries (specified in the `requirements.txt` file)
- A dataset with customer information and churn labels (binary churn or not churn)

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

cd Churn-Prediction


3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended).

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'



4. Install the required Python libraries.

pip install -r requirements.txt



## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook.

jupyter notebook



2. Open the `Churn_Prediction.ipynb` notebook to start using the system.

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to load data, preprocess it, train machine learning models, and predict customer churn.

4. You can also modify the notebook to suit your specific needs, add more data, or experiment with different machine learning models.

## Data

The project requires a dataset with customer information and churn labels. You can use public datasets, obtain data from your organization's CRM system, or create a synthetic dataset for experimentation.



## Acknowledgments

- The project may use publicly available customer churn datasets from sources like Kaggle or academic repositories.

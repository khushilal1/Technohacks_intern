Email/SMS Spam Detection System

Overview
This project is a spam detection system for email and SMS messages. It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to classify messages as either spam or not spam. The user interacts with the system through a user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit.

Features
User-Friendly Web Interface: The system provides a simple and intuitive web interface that allows users to enter text messages and receive instant feedback on whether the message is likely spam or not.

Spam Classification: The system uses a trained machine learning model to classify messages as spam or not spam based on their content.

Customizable Models: You can easily swap out the machine learning model used for classification or fine-tune the existing one to improve accuracy.

Data Visualization: It includes interactive data visualizations to display statistics on the performance of the system, such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

Getting Started
To get started with the Email/SMS Spam Detection System, follow these steps:

1.Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine.
git clone https://github.com/khushilal1/Technohacks_intern/tree/main/sms_spam_classifier

2.Install Dependencies: Install the required Python packages by running:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3.Data Preparation:  you can prepare  own dataset or use a pre-existing one.

4.Run the Web Application: Start the Streamlit web application to interact with the spam detection system:
streamlit run app.py

5.Interact with the System: Open a web browser and navigate to the URL provided by Streamlit. You can now enter text messages to classify them as spam or not spam.

Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

app.py: This is the main Streamlit application script that defines the user interface and integrates the spam detection model.
